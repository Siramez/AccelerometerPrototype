Thank you for purchasing the Simple Low-Poly Mini Airplanes asset!

Please use the Prefab objects included in the package.

These two aircraft are designed to help cover two different art styles -- The flat-faced low poly look, and the smooth-faced low poly look.
I plan on updating this package every two weeks with more skins and aircraft. Please feel free to suggest ones you may like!
The stick, elevator, ailerons, windshield, and wheels are all individial on each of these aircraft and can be manipulated for animation or kept as-is.
Colliders have been attached to appropriate objects.
